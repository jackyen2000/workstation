import random
dna = ["A","G","C","T"]
#output a random base
print(random.choice(dna))
Now to generate a specific number of random bases, all we have to do is use Pythonâ€™s range function:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
import random
dna = ["A","G","C","T"]
#initialise empty string
#this is where the bases will be added as they are generated
random_sequence=''
# We'll create a string of 100 random bases
for i in range(0,100):
    random_sequence+=random.choice(dna)
print(random_sequence)
